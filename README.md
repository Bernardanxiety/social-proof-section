Hello, I'am Bernard and this is my take on frontendmentor's social proof section challenge.

I did it but i feel like i've achieved this in a somewhat disgusting way, i basically slapped flexbox everywhere and im not happy with it?.

Also, didn't know how to add height to 3 bottom card's container so i just added margin-top to 2 cards because i assume translateY would overflow anything that would be under them? 

If i did anything bad enough that you would kill me, please tell me so i can improve and grow!
